<h1>Hi!</h1>
<div class = "line"></div>
<p> Hello Everyone! I am going to tell you why I like singing. First of all I like singing because it is sooooooooo much fun and I first started like singing when I was 8 or 9 years old and my favorite singer is none other than Ariana Grande! She is my fav singer. Singing is known to release endorphins, the feel-good brain chemical that makes you feel uplifted and happy. The response creates an immediate sense of pleasure, regardless of what the singing sounds like. Not only that, but singing can simply take your mind off the day's troubles to boost your mood. If I am not feeling happy then I sing to calm me down!!!! This is why my favorite hobby to is singing.
